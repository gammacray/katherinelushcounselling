# Welcome

I would like to acknowledge that I live, work and play on the unceded territory of the Snuneymuxw Nation.  
  
I believe that you have great resources within you to help you to manage whatever led you to be curious about counselling. My purpose as a therapist is to create a safe place for you to explore and recruit your natural abilities to have a happy, healthy, and satisfying life. You deserve happiness. You are capable of having fulfilling relationships, managing your stress, loneliness, hurt, and fear, and exploring your loving, creative self with courage and honesty.  
  
Whether you are worried about a current crisis, you are contemplating a life change, you wish to work on a longstanding problem or habit that you have been struggling with, or you want to learn to love yourself and others more, I hope you decide to take action. You deserve peace and well-being and you have the ability to attain them. Please know that I would be honoured to assist you on your journey.
